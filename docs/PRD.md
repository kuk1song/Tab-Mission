# PRD: Tab Mission (v1.0 Release)

## 1. Goals
This release focuses on transforming the initial MVP into a polished, delightful, and highly reliable product. The primary goals are to:
1.  **Achieve a "Silky Smooth" User Experience:** Eliminate all sources of lag, stutter, or visual inconsistency to mirror the fluid feeling of macOS Mission Control.
2.  **Establish Intelligent & Consistent UI:** Ensure the application is intuitive, remembers user preferences, and handles all edge cases (like uncapturable pages) gracefully and consistently.
3.  **Solidify the Core Feature Set:** Finalize the core functionality around navigation, search, and window management, providing a robust foundation for future iterations.

## 2. Core UX Pillars & Feature Breakdown

### Pillar 1: Silky Smooth & Responsive
*This pillar is about ensuring every interaction feels instant, fluid, and satisfying.*

*   **Symmetric Open/Close Animations:**
    *   **Feature:** Implemented a reverse-staggered "sucked back" closing animation that is the perfect counterpart to the staggered opening animation.
    *   **User Benefit:** Creates a polished and intuitive feeling that the tab grid is an overlay that can be summoned and dismissed, rather than just a window that appears and disappears.
*   **Instant UI Responsiveness (First Interaction):**
    *   **Feature:** Resolved a critical bug where the first user interaction (hover/click) had a noticeable delay. The root cause was main thread contention, and it was fixed by deferring the non-essential `startThumbnailCapture` task by 100ms.
    *   **User Benefit:** The application feels professional and reliable from the very first moment of use.
*   **Debounced Search:**
    *   **Feature:** The search input is debounced by 200ms.
    *   **User Benefit:** Rapidly typing in the search box is now a fluid experience, free of UI lag, even with a large number of tabs.

### Pillar 2: Intelligent & Consistent
*This pillar focuses on making the extension feel smart, reliable, and predictable.*

*   **Robust Window State Persistence:**
    *   **Feature:** The window's size and position are now managed by the background service worker, using `onBoundsChanged` and `onRemoved` events for 100% reliable state saving.
    *   **User Benefit:** The user's workspace is respected and remembered perfectly, every time. The window always reopens exactly where they last left it.
*   **Unified Thumbnail Fallback:**
    *   **Feature:** All scenarios where a thumbnail cannot be generated (system pages, sleeping tabs, dev servers, errors) now fall back to a single, consistent, and informative "sleeping tab" style, which displays the page title and hostname.
    *   **User Benefit:** Eliminates all confusing UI states (e.g., abstract single letters, redundant text). The interface is now predictable and communicates clearly what each tab is, regardless of its state.
*   **Persistent User Filters:**
    *   **Feature:** The state of the "Show sleeping" and "Show all windows" checkboxes are saved and restored across sessions.
    *   **User Benefit:** Reduces repetitive actions. The user can set their preferred view once, and the extension will remember it.

### Pillar 3: Clear & Controllable
*This pillar is about empowering the user and ensuring they always feel in control.*

*   **Dynamic Shortcut Display & Access:**
    *   **Feature:** The toolbar now dynamically shows the user's current keyboard shortcut and provides a direct link to the Chrome settings page to change it.
    *   **User Benefit:** Lowers the learning curve and makes a core feature (the shortcut) highly visible and easily configurable.
*   **Window Reset:**
    *   **Feature:** A dedicated reset button allows the user to instantly return the window to its default, centered state.
    *   **User Benefit:** Provides a simple "escape hatch" if the window is resized or moved to an inconvenient location.

## 3. Future Roadmap
With v1.0 complete, the focus will shift to:
*   **Advanced Thumbnail Logic:** Improving thumbnail quality and success rate.
*   **Evolved "Art Mode":** Implementing a true weighted Treemap layout.
*   **Deeper Animations:** Exploring more physics-based interaction animations.
